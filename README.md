# Juzmooth

A web application where Juzmooth owners can manage orders,
databases, and tracking deliveries.

Built on a backend with `express`/`sequelize` and a frontend with
`react`/`redux`.

## Setup

To use this as boilerplate, you'll need to take the following steps:

- Create a new, empty empty repo on Github and clone it to your local machine
- Run the following commands:

Now that you've got the code, follow these steps to get acclimated:

- Update project name and description in `package.json`
- `npm install`
- Create two postgres databases (`MY_APP_NAME` should match the `name`
  parameter in `package.json`):

```
createdb $MY_APP_NAME

```

- `npm run start-dev`
